# _How to design a TVC gimbal to prevent collisions_

## Kinematic Reference Volume

This will walk you through designing a kinematic reference volume that you can
use to visualize and verify where the TVC mount will swing at its greatest extent.
Knowing this can allow for better servo placement.

1. After designing your motor retainer tube take a side projection of it's outline

2. Rotate off center axis by the maximum expected deflection
   (in this example 6.91 degrees)

3. Using center axis as a splitter and reference axis, revolve both halves of the
   sketch

4. In assembly environment, set reference geometry to disabled

**Now get out there and design some fresh gimbals!**
