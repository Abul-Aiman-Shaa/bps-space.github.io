## Software

-   [FreeCAD] - Free and open source CAD tool. Quite basic compared to other
    commercial CAD programs, but most of the features offered by those programs
    are very unlikely to be needed by amateurs or hobbyists.
-   [OpenSCAD] - This is a weird one. Rather than graphically editing your
    3d models, like you would do in all other CAD programs, this program
    works more like a scripting language for writing your CAD as code, leaving
    the artistic aspects of design. It takes parametric modelling to its furthest
    extent.
-   [Fusion360] - Commercial CAD offered by Autodesk. Free for hobbyists and
    students. Windows/macos only and forces online storage of your CAD. Many
    makers swear by this program.
-   [Autodesk Inventor][inventor] - Windows only. Has a student license. Very
    featured, but aimed more at professionals than hobbyists.

## Hardware Supplier

-   [McMaster-Carr] - Your one stop shop for anything hardware. Everything you could
    find at your local hardware store plus more. Metal inserts for your 3d prints,
    fasteners for your anything, they will have it.
