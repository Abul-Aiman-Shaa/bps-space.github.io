Launching rockets is the fun part but before you can fly your rocket, you need
to secure a safe, secluded location to launch. This article should help prepare
you for selecting and securing a launch site.

## Finding a site

When you launch rockets, the hope is that they will travel straight up, but this
is not always the case. Even if your rocket travels perfectly up, staying above
the launch pad, your recovery system (eg. parachute) may be susceptible to winds
and can carry the rocket for many feet laterally before returning to the ground.
These reasons are why the [NAR Safety Codes][nar-codes] define safe launch site
dimensions. Trust me, you will want a bigger field than you think, especially if
you are using parachutes.

Using mapping software such as [Google Maps][google-maps], you can survey the area,
and locate a field that matches your requirements (eg. measuring the approximate
dimensions using a tool like one [built into google maps][google-maps-measure]).
A good starting point may be to find a local [NAR club][nar-club-locator] and to
talk to them about where they launch from.

## Getting permission to launch

If you do not own the land that you plan to launch from which will be most cases,
unless you own acres of land, then you will have to get permission to use the
land to launch your rockets.
