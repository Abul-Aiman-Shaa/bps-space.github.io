This may sound extreme, but for almost every regulation, there was someone that
did such a thing before the regulation existed and either hurt themselves,
or someone else to the point where a regulatory authority saw fit to
make such actions regulated.

motors. There are so many regulations due to the dangerous nature of building a
rocker motor.
